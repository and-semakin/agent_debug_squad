# Agent Debug Squad

[![CI](https://github.com/and-semakin/agent_debug_squad/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/and-semakin/agent_debug_squad/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Agent Debug Squad is a local, REST-controlled coordinator for long-lived coding-agent sessions. It gives a facilitator a small common API for starting turns, preserving backend sessions, collecting streamed artifacts, and resetting individual agents without losing the rest of the review.

The project is intentionally lightweight: one Go process owns one YAML-configured squad and stores all state as readable files inside the target workspace.

## Why It Exists

Coding-agent CLIs expose different flags, session formats, and streaming protocols. Agent Debug Squad normalizes the lifecycle around a few operations:

- configure named agents with distinct roles and models;
- run different agents independently or in parallel;
- resume each backend's conversation across turns;
- stream stdout and backend events into inspectable artifacts;
- interrupt and reset one stuck agent without restarting the squad;
- let an external facilitator coordinate review, critique, and implementation rounds through HTTP.

Supported backends are Codex CLI, Cursor Agent CLI, OpenCode, Kimi CLI, and a deterministic fake backend for local smoke tests.

## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Go 1.22 or newer;
- the CLI or service required by every backend in your chosen YAML config.

Install the current release from GitHub:

```sh
go install github.com/and-semakin/agent_debug_squad/cmd/agent-debug-squad@latest
```

Or run the checkout directly with the fake-backend example, which requires no external AI service:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/and-semakin/agent_debug_squad.git
cd agent_debug_squad
go run ./cmd/agent-debug-squad serve --config examples/squad.yaml
```

The example listens only on `127.0.0.1:8080`. In another terminal:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/agents

curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/agents/Reviewer/runs?wait=true&timeout_seconds=30' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"message":"Review this debugging hypothesis."}'
```

## Configuration

A squad is a YAML file with session storage, a loopback address, and one or more named agents:

```yaml
session_name: local-review
workspace_dir: .
state_dir_name: .agent-debug-squad
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 8080
defaults:
  yolo: false
agents:
  - name: Reviewer
    backend: cursor
    startup_prompt: |
      Review the repository. Report concrete findings and do not edit files.
    options:
      command: cursor-agent
      model: composer-2.5
      mode: ask
      yolo: false
      env:
        - NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1
      inherit_env:
        - PATH
        - HOME
        - HTTP_PROXY
        - HTTPS_PROXY
        - NO_PROXY
```

See [examples/squad.yaml](examples/squad.yaml) for a self-contained fake squad, [examples/cursor-squad.yaml](examples/cursor-squad.yaml) for a read-only Cursor reviewer, and [configs/code-review-squad.yaml](configs/code-review-squad.yaml) for a larger facilitator/implementer/critic setup.

### Backend Notes

| Backend | Connection | Session continuity | Important options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `codex` | CLI process | Codex resume ID | `command`, `model`, `reasoning`, `yolo` |
| `cursor` | Cursor Agent CLI | Cursor `session_id` | `command`, `model`, `mode`, `sandbox`, `yolo` |
| `opencode` | Local HTTP server | OpenCode session ID | `base_url`, `model`, `timeout_seconds` |
| `kimi` | CLI process | Kimi local session | `command`, `model`, optional `session_root` |
| `fake` | In process | Deterministic state | none |

`defaults.yolo` is `true` when omitted. Codex maps YOLO to its approval/sandbox bypass flags, and Cursor maps it to `--force`. Reviewer roles should explicitly use `yolo: false`; Cursor reviewers should additionally use a read-only `mode` such as `ask` or `plan`.

Cursor model IDs depend on the account and current catalog. Verify them before use:

```sh
cursor-agent --list-models
```

## Environment And Secrets

CLI-backed agents receive a constrained environment rather than the server's complete ambient environment:

- `options.env` sets explicit `KEY=value` entries on one agent process;
- `options.inherit_env` copies only the named variables from the server process;
- later explicit entries override inherited values.

Keep credentials out of committed YAML. Prefer environment variables, an OS credential store, or a private ignored launcher/config. The checked-in proxy URLs use the reserved `.example` domain and are non-functional placeholders.

Cursor browser authentication normally requires inheriting `HOME`; API-key authentication requires `CURSOR_API_KEY`. When Cursor uses `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY`, also set `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1`. Inherit `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` if the proxy performs TLS inspection.

## HTTP API

The main endpoints are:

```text
GET  /health
GET  /agents
GET  /runs
GET  /runs/{run_id}
POST /agents/{agent}/runs
POST /agents/{agent}/reset
GET  /transcript
```

Append `?wait=true&timeout_seconds=N` when creating a run or reading one by ID to long-poll for progress. A wait timeout does not cancel the run; it returns the latest `RunRecord`. Starting a second run for an already-busy agent returns `409 Conflict`.

Active run records include observable progress:

```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "progress": {
    "phase": "waiting_for_subagent",
    "last_activity_at": "2026-08-27T14:07:48Z",
    "child_last_activity_at": "2026-08-27T14:07:48Z",
    "subagents": [
      {
        "id": "agent-0",
        "parent_id": "main",
        "status": "running",
        "last_activity_at": "2026-08-27T14:07:48Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The same fields are returned by `GET /runs`, `GET /runs/{run_id}`, and timed-out long polls. Kimi runs enter `waiting_for_subagent` when the root stream calls the `Agent` tool and return to `running` when that tool result arrives. While the root stream is waiting, the Kimi adapter watches the matching local Kimi session's `state.json` and child `wire.jsonl` files so `child_last_activity_at` continues to advance. This visibility is a liveness signal for facilitators; the service does not automatically force-reset a quiet run.

Reset an idle agent so its next turn starts a fresh backend session:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/agents/Reviewer/reset
```

Force-reset a stuck agent and mark its active run as interrupted:

```sh
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/agents/Reviewer/reset?force=true'
```

The service deliberately accepts only loopback hosts because the v1 API has no authentication. Do not expose it directly to a network.

## Artifacts

Each session is stored below `<workspace_dir>/<state_dir_name>/sessions/<session_id>/`:

```text
config.json
transcript.jsonl
agents/<agent_name>/state.json
runs/<run_id>/run.json
runs/<run_id>/<agent_name>.events.jsonl
runs/<run_id>/<agent_name>.txt
runs/<run_id>/<agent_name>.stderr.log
```

The files are designed to be readable by people, scripts, and other agents. Add the configured state directory to the workspace's `.gitignore`; runtime transcripts may contain source code, prompts, or model output.

## Codex Skill

A portable Codex skill for operating Agent Debug Squad is included at [skills/agent-debug-squad/SKILL.md](skills/agent-debug-squad/SKILL.md). Copy the `agent-debug-squad` directory into your Codex skills directory if you want it available outside this repository. Keep machine-specific paths and credentials in local configuration rather than editing the tracked copy.

## Development

Run the complete test suite:

```sh
go test ./...
```

Build the CLI:

```sh
go build ./cmd/agent-debug-squad
```

The design records and implementation plans under [docs/superpowers](docs/superpowers) document the project's SDD history. [docs/code-review-squad.md](docs/code-review-squad.md) describes the larger example workflow.

## Current Scope

Agent Debug Squad is a local developer tool, not a hosted multi-tenant service. It does not provide API authentication, distributed scheduling, a browser UI, or automatic agent-to-agent broadcast. A facilitator must send explicit turns, and agents exchange longer results through the persisted artifact files.

Agent Debug Squad is released under the [BSD 3-Clause License](LICENSE).
